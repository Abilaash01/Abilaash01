# 👋 Hi, I'm Abilaash

I'm a **Computer Engineer specializing in Embedded Systems and Firmware Development**, with hands-on experience building software that interfaces directly with hardware. My interests span **SoC platforms, real-time systems, IoT devices, robotics, and low-level software**, supported by a strong foundation in computer architecture and operating systems.

I enjoy working close to the hardware—designing reliable firmware, debugging system-level issues, and building software that bridges physical devices and higher-level applications.
